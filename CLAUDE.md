# CLAUDE.md — SiftStack

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## GSD Planning Workflow

This project uses the GSD (`/gsd-*`) workflow for the **KY Probate & Lis Pendens Automation** milestone. Planning artifacts live in `.planning/` (gitignored — local-only):

- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — 7 phases, each aligned 1:1 with a buildable spec in `docs/`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — 19 REQ-IDs (NAME/TITLE/EQUITY/CONTACT/FIT/COVER/LP) traced to phases
- `.planning/codebase/` — codebase map (STACK, ARCHITECTURE, STRUCTURE, CONVENTIONS, TESTING, INTEGRATIONS, CONCERNS)
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/STATE.md` — project context + current status

**Phase → spec mapping** (plan each with `/gsd-plan-phase N --prd docs/<spec>.md`):
1 Name resolver (`phase_2e`) · 2 Title-path (`phase_2f`) · 3 Lien-sweep equity (`phase_2` §2d) · 4 Fit gate (`phase_2h`) · 5 Skip-trace+guard (`phase_2g`) · 6 Re-poll+no-probate (`phase_2j`) · 7 Lis pendens on Apify (`phase_3`).

Evidence base: `docs/probate_enrichment_lessons.md` (128-case review). This milestone is a correctness/coverage **layer** over the already-shipped happy-path pipeline — audit existing `src/` modules against the tightened specs before building.

## Project Overview

**SiftStack** — Full-stack real estate investing operations platform built around DataSift.ai CRM. Covers the entire REI business lifecycle:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Web scraping tnpublicnotice.com (foreclosures, tax sales, probates), scanned PDF import, courthouse terminal photo import (probate, eviction, code violations, divorce), Dropbox auto-polling
2. **Enrichment Pipeline:** 10+ steps — Smarty address standardization, Zillow property data, Knox County Tax API, obituary/heir research, Ancestry.com SSDI, Tracerfy skip trace, Trestle phone scoring, entity research
3. **Deal Analysis:** Comparable sales (Two-Bucket ARV), rehab estimation (4-tier room-by-room), deal analyzer (MAO/ROI/financing scenarios)
4. **Market Intelligence:** Zip code scoring, Market Finder reports, cash buyer list building, investor portfolio analysis
5. **CRM Automation:** DataSift upload, 26 TCA sequence templates, 12 niche sequential marketing presets, filter preset management, SiftMap sold property tagging
6. **Lead Management:** 4 Pillars of Motivation auto-qualification, STABM daily routine, pipeline reporting, deep prospecting (4-level framework)
7. **Operations:** Acquisition playbook generator (SOPs, scripts, checklists), Slack/Discord notifications, Google Drive upload, Apify Actor deployment

Currently focused on Knox and Blount counties, Tennessee.

8. **REI Skill Library:** 13 Claude Co-Work skill files (`.skill`/`.plugin` ZIPs) for distribution to DataSift community via [learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei](https://learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei). Skills teach Claude specific REI workflows when uploaded to Co-Work sessions or Projects.

## Deep Prospecting Workflow (single property)

**Always use the pipeline. Do NOT hand-roll one-off recon scripts as the deliverable.** The point of having `deep_prospector.py` + `report_generator.py` is for them to produce the structured Excel + branded PDF every time.

### Canonical sequence

1. **Discovery — fill the NoticeData CSV row** (raw recon scripts feed this; they are NOT the deliverable):
   - **PVA detail (KY):** `kentucky_pva_lookup.search_by_address()` + `get_detail()` — owner, parcel_id, lrsn, assessed value, deed book/page, year built, sqft, baths
   - **Probate (KY):** `kcoj_case_detail.login_as_guest()` + `search_case()` / party search — case number, decedent, executor (P/EE), attorney (AP), party-type graph
   - **Mortgage history (KY):** `jefferson_deeds_scraper._search_names_unique()` + `_fetch_deed_list()` + `_fetch_pdetail()` — open mortgages, releases, original principal, lien chain
   - **Obituary:** `obituary_enricher` (TN) or WebSearch + WebFetch for KY — DOD, surviving spouse/heirs, predeceased, pets/charities (DOD sanity check: reject obit > 3yrs older than filing date)
   - **One-off recon scripts** at `scripts/find_<lastname>_*.py` are fine for raw discovery, but their output goes INTO the CSV — they are not the final report

2. **Pipeline — run the orchestrator:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py deep-prospect --csv-path output/<name>_recon/<name>_record.csv --depth 3
   # Produces: output/deep_prospecting_L3_<timestamp>.xlsx
   ```

3. **PDF deliverable:**
   ```python
   from report_generator import generate_record_pdf
   from notice_parser import NoticeData
   # Load CSV row into NoticeData, then:
   generate_record_pdf(notice, output_dir=Path("output/reports"))
   # Produces: output/reports/<address_slug>_<date>.pdf
   ```

### NoticeData fields to populate for a probate prospect (minimum)

`address, city, state, zip, owner_name, notice_type=probate, county, decedent_name, date_of_death, owner_deceased=yes, obituary_url, decision_maker_name, decision_maker_relationship, decision_maker_status=verified_living, decision_maker_source, decision_maker_street/city/state/zip, parcel_id, estimated_value, year_built, bathrooms, bedrooms, sqft, lot_size, case_number, estate_attorney_name, courtnet_party_types, mortgage_origination_date, mortgage_original_amount, mortgage_balance_estimate, heirs_verified_living, heirs_verified_deceased, signing_chain_count, signing_chain_names, dm_confidence, dm_confidence_reason, property_owner_status, deceased_indicator`

See `notice_parser.NoticeData` for the full ~60-field schema.

### What deep-prospect DOES NOT do

- **Skip trace (Tracerfy + Trestle phone scoring) now AUTO-runs for qualified leads in BOTH the daily/Apify pipeline AND `deep-prospect`** (Phase 5: `deep_prospector._run_level_1` calls `batch_skip_trace([notice])` when the DM has no phones, then the death/identity guard). It is gated by the Phase 4 wholesale-fit score (only fit leads are traced) and protected by the death/identity guard (dead/wrong-person phones are suppressed, not dialed). Use `--no-skip-trace` to opt out (suppresses Tracerfy in both the daily pipeline and deep-prospect). For manual augmentation you can still run a TruePeopleSearch / FastPeopleSearch / Radaris waterfall.
- DataSift upload — separate `--upload-datasift` flag on the daily/historical commands

## Architecture

**Data flows:**
- **Web scrape:** `main.py` → `scraper.py` → `captcha_solver.py` → `notice_parser.py` + `foreclosure_filter.py` → enrichment → CSV
- **PDF import:** `main.py` → `pdf_importer.py` (pypdfium2 → `image_utils.py` OCR) → enrichment → CSV
- **Photo import:** `main.py` → `photo_importer.py` (OpenCV → `image_utils.py` OCR → `llm_parser.py`) → enrichment → CSV
- **Dropbox watch:** `dropbox_watcher.py` → `photo_importer.py` → enrichment → CSV (auto-polling loop)
- **Market Finder:** `extract_market_finder.py` → DataSift Market Finder (Playwright) → paginate all ZIP + neighborhood data → JSON → `generate_knox_report.py` → 7-sheet Excel

- **main.py** — CLI entry point. Parses args (`daily`/`historical`, `--split`, `--counties`, `--types`, `-v`). Filters saved searches by county/type, orchestrates scrape → dedup → export, logs run summary stats.
- **scraper.py** — Playwright browser automation. Reuses saved session cookies when possible, falls back to fresh login. Selects each saved search from the Smart Search dropdown (triggers ASP.NET postback), paginates results (50/page max), clicks each View button to open notice detail pages. Uses `last_run.json` for daily mode state, `cookies.json` for session persistence.
- **captcha_solver.py** — Solves reCAPTCHA v2 via **2Captcha API** on every notice detail page. Sends websiteURL + sitekey, gets back a `g-recaptcha-response` token, injects it, clicks "View Notice". Retries up to 3 times. This is the primary bottleneck (~10-30s per notice).
- **notice_parser.py** — Extracts structured fields from raw notice text using regex. There are NO structured HTML fields on the site — address, owner, dates are all embedded in free-text notice bodies. Defines the `NoticeData` dataclass used throughout.
- **foreclosure_filter.py** — Filters foreclosure search results to only keep real first-to-market trustee sales. Matches against observed title variations (substitute/successor trustee sales). Non-foreclosure notice types pass through unfiltered.
- **data_formatter.py** — Deduplicates by address (keeps most recent), then converts `NoticeData` list to Sift upload CSV. Split mode produces `{county}_{type}_{timestamp}.csv` files.
- **config.py** — Credentials (from `.env`), ASP.NET element selectors, saved search definitions, rate limiting constants, paths, image processing thresholds.
- **image_utils.py** — Shared OCR utilities used by both `pdf_importer.py` and `photo_importer.py`. Exports `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) and `ocr_page(image, psm)` with configurable page segmentation mode. Handles Tesseract binary detection.
- **photo_importer.py** — Courthouse phone photo import. OpenCV preprocessing chain (EXIF transpose → blur check → bilateral filter → perspective correction → Otsu threshold) → Tesseract OCR (PSM 4) → LLM parsing → NoticeData. Supports all 7 notice types.
- **dropbox_watcher.py** — Cursor-based Dropbox folder polling. Downloads new photos, resolves county + notice_type from folder path (`/Knox/eviction/photo.jpg`), processes through photo_importer, deletes from Dropbox after success. State persisted to `dropbox_state.json` + `photo_state.json`.
- **report_generator.py** — Generates per-record PDF deep prospecting reports using reportlab. Includes property summary, signing chain with phone tiers, valuation, deceased owner detection. Output to `output/reports/`.
- **extract_market_finder.py** — Playwright automation to extract ALL ZIP code + neighborhood data from DataSift Market Finder. Handles styled-component dropdowns, pagination (20 rows/page), Beamer popup dismissal. Outputs JSON. See "Market Finder Extraction Patterns" below.
- **market_analyzer.py** — ZIP code scoring engine. 6-factor weighted composite (Distress 30%, Value 20%, Equity 15%, Tax Delinquency 15%, Competition 10%, DOM 10%). Grades A/B/C/D, budget allocation across top ZIPs. Reads from scraped notice CSVs in `output/`.
- **drive_uploader.py** — Google Drive upload via service account. `upload_file()` (generic, returns webViewLink) and `upload_csv()` (CSV-specific, returns file ID).

## Site-Specific Details

The site is **ASP.NET WebForms** — all navigation uses `__doPostBack()` with ViewState. Session IDs are embedded in URL paths (`/(S({guid}))/`). Playwright is required because direct HTTP requests would need to manage ViewState/EventValidation manually.

**reCAPTCHA v2 is required on every single notice detail page**, even when logged in. There is no CAPTCHA on login, search, or results pages. The sitekey is hardcoded in `config.py`.

## Saved Searches

8 searches defined in `config.py` as `SAVED_SEARCHES`. Each maps to an exact dropdown option name on the Smart Search dashboard:
- Knox & Blount × (Foreclosure V2, Tax Sale V2, Tax Delinquent V2, Probate V2)

Filterable via `--counties` and `--types` CLI args (comma-separated, or omit for all).

## Key Domain Rules

- **Foreclosure filtering is critical.** Not all notices from "Foreclosure" saved searches are actual foreclosures. The scraper parses each notice's full text and only includes ones with trustee sale language. See `INCLUDE_PHRASES` / `EXCLUDE_PHRASES` in `foreclosure_filter.py`.
- **Probate decision-maker is title-path-dependent (never the deceased).** The DM is the Personal Representative/Executor/Administrator for **standard probate**, but the **successor trustee** when the deed shows a revocable/living trust (the trust can sell without closing probate), and the **surviving owner** when the deed is joint/survivorship (the survivor bypasses probate). The CourtNet executor must NOT overwrite a title-derived DM for trust/survivorship, and for out-of-estate/no-property no DM is named. See `src/kentucky_title_classifier.py` (`classify_title_path` → `title_path`) and the title-aware DM branch in `kcoj_case_detail.apply_parties_to_notice`.
- **Owner names** in foreclosure notices typically appear after "executed by" in the deed of trust language.
- **Rate limiting:** 2-3 second random delays between requests, 3 retries per page.
- **Address dedup:** Same property can appear in multiple notices; `data_formatter.deduplicate()` keeps the most recent.

## Output

CSV files land in `output/` (gitignored). Logs go to `logs/` with timestamped filenames. Sift columns: `date_added, address, city, state, zip, owner_name, notice_type, county, source_url`.

## Apify Deployment

The project runs as an **Apify Actor** in the cloud. When `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME` or `APIFY_TOKEN` is set, `main.py` uses the Actor SDK instead of CLI args.

```bash
# Install Apify CLI
npm install -g apify-cli

# Local test (reads input.json, simulates Actor environment)
apify run --purge

# Deploy to Apify platform
apify login
apify push

# On Apify Console: set up daily schedule and configure secrets in Actor input
```

### Actor Input (configured in Apify Console or `input.json`)
- `mode`: "daily" or "historical"
- `counties` / `types`: arrays to filter saved searches (empty = all)
- `tn_username`, `tn_password`, `captcha_api_key`: secrets (required)
- `google_drive_folder_id`, `google_service_account_key`: optional Google Drive upload
- **`types`, lis pendens, and probate:** the schema default `types` is `["foreclosure"]` only. To run Jefferson County KY lis pendens AND Kentucky probate (KCOJ) on the daily schedule, the Apify schedule must set `types` explicitly to list them, e.g. `["foreclosure", "lis_pendens", "probate"]`. Cross-run dedup is per-source: JCD lis-pendens dedup persists in the Apify Key-Value Store under the `jcd_seen_instruments` key (instrument-key → first-seen date), and KCOJ probate dedup persists under the `kcoj_seen_cases` key (case-number → first-seen date; pre-existing). Both parallel each other so daily re-runs do not re-push the same filings — JCD additionally skips the PDF/OCR fetch for already-seen instruments.

### Actor Output
- **Dataset**: structured records pushed via `Actor.push_data()`
- **Key-value store**: `output.csv` backup
- **Google Drive** (optional): CSV + summary text file uploaded via service account

### Key Files
- `.actor/actor.json` — Actor manifest (name, version, Dockerfile path)
- `.actor/input_schema.json` — Input fields + validation for Apify Console UI
- `Dockerfile` — Based on `apify/actor-python-playwright:3.12`
- `src/drive_uploader.py` — Google Drive upload via base64-encoded service account key
- `input.json` — Local test input (gitignored, contains credentials)

## Courthouse Photo Pipeline (build 1.0.28+)

Courthouse terminal photos → OCR → LLM parse → enrichment → DataSift. Runner takes phone photos at Knox/Blount county terminals, uploads to Dropbox organized as `{county}/{notice_type}/`, system auto-processes.

### Notice Types (7 total)
- `foreclosure`, `tax_sale`, `tax_delinquent`, `probate` — existing from web scraper
- `eviction` — plaintiff = landlord (target contact), defendant = tenant
- `code_violation` — owner of record, violation type, compliance deadline
- `divorce` — petitioner + respondent, property from schedule page
- `lis_pendens` — **JCD-source (Jefferson County KY deeds) notice type, additional to the 7 photo-pipeline types above** — pre-foreclosure court filing scraped via `jefferson_deeds_scraper.py` (not the courthouse-photo pipeline). Maps to the DataSift "Pre-Foreclosure" list.

### Critical OCR Patterns (hard-won from live testing)

**Moire pattern from terminal screens is the #1 OCR killer.** Standard Tesseract preprocessing (adaptive threshold, CLAHE) produces garbage on courthouse terminal photos. The fix:
- **Bilateral filter** (`cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, 15, 75, 75)`) removes moire while preserving text edges
- **Otsu threshold** (`cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU`) after bilateral — auto-determines optimal binary threshold
- **PSM 4** (single column variable text) for terminal screens — NOT PSM 6 (single uniform block) which was the research recommendation but fails in practice
- **Do NOT use `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) on phone photos** — EXIF transpose handles rotation. OSD on raw phone images often fails and the 270° fallback rotates correct images sideways

### Probate Deep Prospecting (from courthouse terminals)

Courthouse probate records have decedent name + PR/executor name but NO property address. Multi-tier lookup fills the gap:

**Property Address Lookup** (Step 3c in enrichment pipeline):
1. **Tier 1: Knox Tax API name search** — search `/parcels/{decedent_name}`, score by token overlap (FIRST MIDDLE LAST → LAST FIRST MIDDLE), accept >= 0.4 match. Tries multiple name variations (with/without suffix, LAST FIRST format, first+last only).
2. **Tier 2: Executor family search** — search Knox Tax API by executor name, look for properties where decedent's last name appears in owner field (family property transferred to executor).
3. **Tier 3: People search** — search TruePeopleSearch/FastPeopleSearch for decedent's last known Knox County address.

**Probate Preset** (obituary enricher):
- Triggers when court record has PR name + decedent name (no address required) — prevents wrong obituary from overriding court-named executor
- Sets DM = the named PR/executor directly, skips obituary search entirely
- Then runs DM address lookup (Knox Tax API → People Search → Tracerfy)

**DOD Sanity Check** (obituary enricher):
- Rejects obituary matches where DOD is > 3 years before the notice filing date (`MAX_DOD_GAP_YEARS = 3`)
- Prevents matching a 2014 obituary to a 2025 court filing (wrong person with same name)
- Applied to both full-page and snippet matches

### Dropbox Folder Structure
```
{DROPBOX_ROOT_FOLDER}/
├── Knox/
│   ├── eviction/
│   ├── code_violation/
│   ├── divorce/
│   ├── foreclosure/
│   ├── tax_sale/
│   └── probate/
└── Blount/
    └── (same subfolders)
```

### Environment Variables
- `DROPBOX_APP_KEY` — Dropbox OAuth2 app key
- `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` — Dropbox OAuth2 app secret
- `DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN` — Dropbox offline refresh token (auto-rotates access tokens)
- `DROPBOX_POLL_INTERVAL` — seconds between polls (default 900 = 15 min)
- `DROPBOX_ROOT_FOLDER` — root folder path in Dropbox (e.g., "TN Public Notice")

### Dependencies (added to requirements.txt)
- `opencv-python-headless>=4.13.0` — image preprocessing (headless = no GUI, saves 26MB in Docker)
- `numpy>=1.26.0` — required by OpenCV
- `dropbox>=12.0.2` — Dropbox SDK (minimum for post-Jan-2026 API compatibility)

## DataSift.ai (REISift) Integration

DataSift.ai (formerly REISift) is the CRM where scraped records land for niche sequential marketing campaigns. There is **no REST API** — upload is via Playwright browser automation of the web UI.

**Domain:** `app.reisift.io` (NOT `app.datasift.ai`). API at `apiv2.reisift.io`.

### Key Files
- `src/datasift_formatter.py` — Transforms `NoticeData` → DataSift CSV (41 columns)
- `src/datasift_uploader.py` — Playwright login + upload wizard + enrich + skip trace + preset management + sequence builder + SiftMap sold workflow
- `test_datasift_upload.py` — Headed browser test (upload + enrich + skip trace)
- `test_manage_presets.py` — Headed browser test (preset discovery + sold exclusion + sequence creation)
- `test_manage_sold.py` — Headed browser test (SiftMap sold property tagging)

### CSV Column Structure (41 columns)
- **Core auto-mapped (11):** Property Street/City/State/ZIP, Owner First/Last Name, Mailing Street/City/State/ZIP, Tags
- **Lists + Notes (2):** Lists (for niche sequential), Notes (contextual per notice type)
- **Built-in fields (13):** Estimated Value, MSL Status, Last Sale Date/Price, Equity Percentage, Tax Deliquent Value, Tax Delinquent Year, Tax Auction Date, Foreclosure Date, Probate Open Date, Personal Representative, Parcel ID, Structure Type, Year Built, Living SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Lot (Acres)
- **Custom fields (15):** Notice Type, County, Date Added, Owner Deceased, Date of Death, Decedent Name, Decision Maker, DM Relationship, DM Confidence, DM 2/3 Name/Relationship, Obituary URL, Source URL

### Niche Sequential Marketing
DataSift's niche sequential system uses filter presets to guide records through SMS → Call → Mail → Deep Prospecting phases. Two preset folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets, courthouse data) and "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets, bulk data). All 21 presets exclude Sold status (build 1.0.23). A "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence in the Transactions folder auto-fires on "Sold" tag to change status, remove from lists, clear tasks, and clear assignee.

- **"Courthouse Data" tag:** Every record gets this tag — signals first-to-market county data (prioritized over bulk data in filter presets)
- **Lists column:** Maps `notice_type` → DataSift list name (`foreclosure` → "Foreclosure", `probate` → "Probate", `tax_sale` → "Tax Sale", `tax_delinquent` → "Tax Delinquent", `eviction` → "Eviction", `code_violation` → "Code Violation", `divorce` → "Divorce", `lis_pendens` → "Pre-Foreclosure"). DataSift auto-creates lists from CSV.
- **Tags:** Courthouse Data, notice_type, county, YYYY-MM date, deceased/living, DM confidence level, has_auction, tax_delinquent, photo_import (for photo-sourced records)

### Upload Wizard (5 Steps)
1. **Setup:** Click "Upload File" sidebar → "Add Data" → dropdown "Uploading a new list not in DataSift yet" → enter list name → organization questions
2. **Tags:** Skip through (tags are in CSV column)
3. **Upload File:** Set file on `input[type="file"]`
4. **Map Columns:** Core address fields auto-map; Tags, Lists, and enrichment columns may need manual mapping
5. **Review + Finish Upload:** Click "Finish Upload" — processing happens in background

### Column Mapping Notes
- Only core address fields (Property Street, City, State, ZIP) reliably auto-map
- Tags, Lists, Estimated Value, and enrichment columns often stay unmapped in step 4
- Notes and MSL Status sometimes auto-map
- Custom fields (TN Public Notice group) require drag-and-drop mapping

### Contact Logic
- **Deceased owners:** Contact = decision maker (first/last name + mailing address from DM)
- **Living owners:** Contact = property owner (owner mailing address, falls back to property address)

### Post-Upload: Enrich + Skip Trace

After CSV upload, the pipeline automatically runs two DataSift actions via Playwright:

1. **Enrich Property Information** (Manage → Enrich Data): Adds SiftMap property data (beds, baths, Zestimate, sqft, sale history) to uploaded records. "Enrich Owners" and "Swap Owners" are OFF — protects our PR/DM contact mapping.
2. **Skip Trace** (Send To → Skip Trace): Pulls phone numbers (up to 5 per owner) + emails via unlimited plan ($97/mo). Adds auto-tag `skip_traced_YYYY-MM`.

Both run in background — tracked in Activity tab. Both are ON by default when `--upload-datasift` is set.

### CLI Flags
```bash
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift        # upload + enrich + skip trace
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-enrich       # upload only, skip enrichment
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-skip-trace   # upload + enrich, skip skip trace
python src/main.py daily --notify-slack            # send run summary to Slack/Discord
```

### Environment Variables
- `DATASIFT_EMAIL` — DataSift login email
- `DATASIFT_PASSWORD` — DataSift login password
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — Slack/Discord webhook for run summaries

### Login Selectors (SPA quirks)
- Hidden checkboxes (Remember me, Terms) — click `<label>` elements, not `<input>`
- Use `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` (not `networkidle` — SPA keeps WebSocket connections open)
- Cookie validation: check for `/dashboard` or `/records` in URL (5s wait for SPA redirect)

### DataSift UI Automation Patterns

Hard-won patterns from build 1.0.22-1.0.23 (SiftMap, preset management, sequence builder). Follow these to avoid repeating past mistakes.

**Styled-Components (no native HTML controls)**
- No native `<select>` elements — all dropdowns are `[class*="Selectstyles__Select"]` containers
- `[class*="SelectValue"]` = current value display; `[class*="SelectOptionContainer"]` = dropdown options
- Multiple Select dropdowns exist per panel (Lists, Tags, Property Status) — always target the **LAST visible one**
- Use `x > 450` bounds check in all JS queries to avoid matching sidebar elements (sidebar is 0-400px)
- React state updates require native setter + event dispatch, not just `.value = ...`:
  ```js
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set;
  setter.call(input, 'new value');
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles: true}));
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles: true}));
  ```

**Panel Scrolling (Playwright scroll fails)**
- Filter panel is a scrollable `<div>`, NOT the viewport — `scroll_into_view_if_needed()` does nothing
- Use JS: `el.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'instant', block: 'center'})` instead
- Filter Presets section is at the BOTTOM of the filter panel — must scroll container down to reveal
- After scrollIntoView, element y-positions may be negative — don't filter by `y > 0` for the target element

**React DnD (Sequence Builder)**
- Cards have `draggable="false"` — Playwright's native drag won't work
- Must use slow mouse drag: `mouse.move()` → `mouse.down()` → 20 incremental steps (50ms each) → `mouse.up()`
- Add 500ms pauses between down/move/up phases
- "Add new Action +" button required for 2nd+ actions; first action uses initial drop zone
- Sidebar cards can scroll out of view when main area scrolls — scroll BOTH source and target into view before drag

**Pointer Interception (common blockers)**
- Beamer NPS survey iframe (`#npsIframeContainer`) blocks ALL pointer events globally — remove from DOM via `_dismiss_popups()`
- `RecordsFiltersstyles__RecordsFiltersSection` elements intercept clicks — use `page.evaluate()` JS click or `force=True`
- When Playwright click fails with "outside of viewport" or "intercept": switch to `page.evaluate(el => el.click())`
- SiftMap PropertyDetails panel blocks sidebar checkboxes — remove from DOM before interactions

**Preset Management Workflow**
- Flow: open filter panel → scroll to bottom → expand "Filter Presets" → expand folder → click preset → modify → Save (not Save New) → confirm overwrite
- Folder names have case variations ("00 Niche" vs "00 NICHE") — use `.toUpperCase()` comparison
- Preset names follow pattern `^\d{2}\.` (e.g., "00. Needs Skipped")
- 2 folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets), "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets)
- All 21 presets have Property Status "Do not include" → "Sold" (build 1.0.23)

**Sequence Builder Workflow**
- Flow: `/sequences` → Create → title + folder → drag trigger → condition → actions tab → drag actions → configure → save
- Duplicate name handling: detect error toast "different sequence title", retry with " V2" suffix
- Actions tab: navigate via "Set the Following Actions" button or URL (`/sequences/new/actions`)
- Autocomplete inputs: after each selection, `fill("")` + Escape to dismiss dropdown before next entry
- "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence exists in Transactions folder (build 1.0.23): Trigger (Property Tags Added) → Condition (Sold) → Actions (Status→Sold, Remove Lists, Clear Tasks, Clear Assignee)

**SiftMap Automation**
- Search by city (NOT county): Knox → "Knoxville, TN", Blount → "Maryville, TN"
- PropertyDetails panel auto-opens on search — remove from DOM before other interactions
- "Add Records to Account" modal: toggle OFF "Do not replace owners", add tags, dismiss dropdown by clicking heading (NOT Escape — clears tags)
- Known limitation: SiftMap filters (price, date) set values visually but don't trigger React re-query. Only sidebar-visible properties (~3-5) get added per run

**Market Finder Extraction Patterns (build 1.0.29+)**

Hard-won patterns from building `extract_market_finder.py`. The Market Finder UI differs significantly from the rest of DataSift.

- **NO HTML `<table>` element** — data table is entirely div-based: `Tablestyles__TableContainer` → `TableRow` → `TableCell` (styled-components). Searching for `<table>` or `<tr>/<td>` finds nothing.
- **PAGINATION, not infinite scroll** — table shows 20 rows per page with "1-20 of N" text and `PaginationInnerContainer` with prev/next `<button>` elements. Must click through ALL pages to get complete data. Knox County has 48 ZIPs (3 pages) and 120+ neighborhoods (7 pages).
- **State/County selection uses `InputMultiSearch`** — NOT styled-component Select dropdowns. Inputs have placeholders: `"Select States"`, `"Select Counties"`, `"Select ZIP Codes"`. Click input → type name → click dropdown result item (`[class*="Item"]:has-text("...")`).
- **ZIP/Neighborhood toggle is a styled Select dropdown** — at the top bar with `Selectstyles__SelectValue` showing current view. Check the displayed text BEFORE clicking — if already on the correct view, clicking toggles AWAY from it. Only click to switch if the displayed text doesn't match the desired view.
- **Beamer push modal (`#beamerPushModal`)** — appears on fresh login, blocks ALL pointer events. Different from the NPS survey (`#npsIframeContainer`). Both must be removed from DOM before any click interactions. Always call dismiss with `force=True` as fallback.
- **Page body scrolling required** — pagination controls are at `y=1867`, below the viewport (`clientH=824`). Must scroll `AdminPage__AdminPageBody` container down before pagination buttons are accessible.
- **Summary panel on right side** — shows county-level aggregates: Median Home Value, Homes on Market, Mo. Investor Transactions, Homes Sold Last Month, Market Rent, Gross Rental Yield, Homeownership Rate. Extract via regex on page text.

```bash
# Extract all Market Finder data for a county
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox" -v
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox,Blount" --headless

# Output: JSON file in output/market_finder_{state}_{county}_{timestamp}.json
```

## Brand PDF Standard (LOCKED)

**Every PDF deliverable the business produces uses the visual standard set by the *5510 Bruns Dr* and *6307 Highway 329* lender review flyers** — black header band, cream background, red brand accent, red 2pt rule under the header, big serif title, red-bar section labels, branded footer with company line + `PAGE NN / TT`. This applies to lender flyers, disposition flyers, internal SOPs, checklists, market reports, buyer packets — anything we hand to a person.

**Implementation:**
- [src/brand_pdf.py](src/brand_pdf.py) — reusable primitives (palette, type system, `page_painter`, `status_bar`, `section_label`, `hrule`, `make_doc`). Import this in every new deliverable.
- [src/checklist_pdf.py](src/checklist_pdf.py) — minimal reference deliverable.
- [docs/brand/pdf_styling.md](docs/brand/pdf_styling.md) — full visual spec, palette table, typography table, tagline conventions per deliverable type, code template.

**Rules:**
- Do **not** introduce new colors, fonts, or layout chrome in deliverable files. Add to `brand_pdf` so the brand stays consistent.
- Do **not** ship a deliverable in any other style without explicit approval — consistency across deliverables is the brand.
- `src/disposition_flyer.py` predates this standard and uses its own palette/layout. It will be migrated to `brand_pdf` in a future pass. New deliverables must use `brand_pdf` from day one.

## Disposition Flyer (build 1.0.30+)

1-page buyer-facing PDF for wholesale dispositions. Pulls property data from Jefferson PVA, downloads first iPhone photo from Google Drive, builds a branded flyer with hero photo + stats + asking/ARV + additional info + photos link, uploads PDF back to the property folder. Source: `src/disposition_flyer.py`.

### CLI

```bash
python src/main.py disposition \
    --address "1521 Sale Ave" --city Louisville --state KY --zip-code 40215 \
    --asking 199999 --arv 250000 \
    --bedrooms 2 \
    --additional-info 'Vacant; Sold AS-IS; Cash close 14 days; Bring offers'

# Asking/ARV accept text (wholesalers often use phrases):
#   --asking 'Taking All Offers'   (auto-shrinks to fit)
#   --arv '$360,000+'              (passes through verbatim)
#   --asking 199999                (formatted as $199,999)

# Override PVA values or supply when PVA returns nothing (Oldham County, etc.):
#   --bathrooms 2.5 --sqft 2391 --year-built 1984 --acreage 0.25

# Skip Drive upload (preview locally):
#   --no-upload

# Skip interactive prompts (fail if PVA misses a field):
#   --non-interactive
```

### Drive folder layout

```
<REDNOUR_DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID>/        # Shared Drive 'Properties'
└── 1521 Sale Ave/                       # match by address (case-insensitive)
    ├── Photos/                          # optional — falls back to flat layout
    │   ├── 00_front.jpg
    │   └── 01_kitchen.jpg
    ├── IMG_3569.HEIC                    # OR photos directly here (iPhone uploads)
    ├── IMG_3570.HEIC
    └── 1521_Sale_Ave_Flyer.pdf          # generated PDF lands here, replaces prior
```

Hero photo = first image alphabetically. To pick a specific shot, rename it to sort first (e.g., `00_hero.HEIC`). Re-runs auto-trash any prior PDF with the same filename so the buyer link always shows one definitive flyer.

### Locked layout (do not change without explicit permission)

The visual format was iterated and approved as "the standard". Future tweaks should be intentional, not drift:

- **Header band**: logo (left, 110×55) · "Rednour Real Estate Services" + "Investment Opportunity — Off-Market" tagline (center) · "CALL DIRECT" + phone in red (right) · 2pt red `LINEBELOW`
- **Hero photo**: 2.9" tall, full width, proportional fit (single hero — no second photo)
- **Location line**: 18pt bold, centered. **City, state, zip ONLY — no street address.** Format `"LOUISVILLE, KY 40215"`. Withholding the street is intentional: buyers must call to get the exact location, which gates the flyer behind a phone touch and filters out tire-kickers. Do not change without explicit permission.
- **Stats strip**: 4 light-bg boxes — Beds | Baths | Sqft (with `BUILT YYYY` + `+NNN BSMT` sub-label) | Acreage
- **Money row**: ASKING PRICE | ARV (label is exactly "ARV", no parenthetical) — both red boxes pinned to identical row heights `[14, 38]` so different fonts (auto-shrink for long strings) don't make one taller than the other
- **Info row**: Additional Info card (red header strip + bullets, light body) | dark "VIEW ALL PHOTOS →" button — both 1.5" tall
- **CTA footer**: red bar, exact text `"CALL (PHONE) TO LOCK UP THIS DEAL TODAY"`, company name as sub
- **Page constraint**: must fit on 1 page (Letter, 0.4" margins). If you add content, shrink something else.

### Required env vars

- `PVA_EMAIL` / `PVA_PASSWORD` — Jefferson County KY PVA login (1 concurrent session, off-hours preferred)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` — base64-encoded JSON. Service account email must be granted **Content Manager** on the Shared Drive (or parent folder). Editor maps to Contributor on Shared Drives, which can upload but cannot delete — needed for the trash-prior-flyer step in `upload_pdf` to work. Without Content Manager you'll see a one-line warning per re-run and accumulate duplicates.
- `REDNOUR_DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` — Drive folder ID containing the per-property subfolders. Lives in a Shared Drive (uses `supportsAllDrives=True` everywhere)
- `COMPANY_NAME` (default: `Rednour Real Estate Services`)
- `COMPANY_PHONE` (default: `5022241882`, formatted on render as `(502) 224-1882`)

### Logo

Drop a PNG at `assets/rednour_logo.png` (110pt × 55pt, transparent background ideal). Falls back to text "REDNOUR" in red if the file is missing.

### HEIC support

iPhone photos upload as `image/heif`. `pillow-heif` is registered at module import to decode HEIC; `_normalize_image` re-encodes to JPEG for reportlab and bakes in EXIF orientation so portrait shots aren't sideways.

### Shared Drive gotcha

The Drive API silently returns 404 for Shared Drive content unless `supportsAllDrives=True` + `includeItemsFromAllDrives=True` are set on every call. All disposition flyer code paths set both via `_SHARED_DRIVE_KW`. `drive_uploader.upload_file()` also passes `supportsAllDrives=True` on `files().create()`.

### PVA data extraction

`kentucky_pva_lookup.get_detail()` returns a flat dict from both `<dl><dt><dd>` pairs AND the area `<table>` (Main Unit / Basement / Attic / Garage rows). Sqft headline = Main Unit Finished (falls back to Gross if Finished is dashed). Basement Finished shows as a `+NNN BSMT` sub-label. Bathrooms = Full + 0.5×Half. PVA does NOT publish bedroom count — always prompted or supplied via `--bedrooms`.

### Counties outside Jefferson

PVA lookup will return zero rows for non-Jefferson properties (e.g., Oldham County / Crestwood). Tool degrades gracefully: prompts interactively for missing stats, or accepts them via CLI flags in non-interactive mode.

These values are identical across all skills that reference them:
- **Phone tiers:** 81-100 (Dial First), 61-80 (Dial Second), 41-60 (Dial Third), 21-40 (Dial Fourth), 0-20 (Drop)
- **Preset folders:** "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets), "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets)

- **Comp adjustments:** Bedroom $5,000, Bathroom $7,500, $/sqft $85, Age $500/yr (from `comp_analyzer.py`)
- **Financing defaults:** HML 12%, conventional 7%, 2 points, 2.5% closing (from `deal_analyzer.py`)
- **DOD sanity:** MAX_DOD_GAP_YEARS = 3 (from `obituary_enricher.py`)
- **Notice types:** 7 photo-pipeline types (foreclosure, tax_sale, tax_delinquent, probate, eviction, code_violation, divorce) + `lis_pendens` (JCD/Jefferson-deeds source, additional to the 7)

### Key Corrections Made During Optimization (April 2026)
- **Hardcoded credentials removed** from sift-market-research (had email/password in SKILL.md)
- **Bedroom adjustment corrected** from $10K to $5K in real-estate-comping (matched to `comp_analyzer.py`)
- **HML points corrected** from 0% to 2% in deal-analyzer (matched to `deal_analyzer.py DEFAULT_HARD_MONEY_POINTS`)
- **Linux paths fixed** in sequential-presets (was `/home/ubuntu/skills/...`, now relative)
- **Preset names aligned** across 3 skills to match `niche_sequential.py` source code
- **Transfer tax labeled** as Tennessee-specific in deal-analyzer with state reference table for top 10 states
- **"Substantial renovation" defined** in real-estate-comping: kitchen + 1 bath minimum (~$15K spend)
